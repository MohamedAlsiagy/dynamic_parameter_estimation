finish debugging thread faliure when controller node encounter faliure
unload and reload robot only when internal faliure to prevent multiple instances of controllers
if robot has three faliures then skip it
using wsBuild.bash remove all loaded ros nodes
change the update rate of the dataset to be around 200Hz
make saving robots from robot making script get a summary at the end to be able to be recreated
make the colsions for the circular profile square profile as it consumes uch of cpu and slows update rate
  - may be make all square but stp files are based on differant shape profiles
make pid control velocity profile for smoother motion
make another progree bar for trajectories completed for robot ex: 4/16
make an rviz visualizer to make sure that the simulations are right
make gazebo colors the same as generated in urdf?
  - this to make comparing easier
  - proobably have to change the arm maker script for that to add another file
make just one controller and make all the robots read from it and modify it dynamically , by this way when redoing a robot you would be able to make a namespace like robot_0_3
